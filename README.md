# FOVE Unity Sample
This simple project demonstrates how to use the FOVE Unity plugin. It includes objects which react to gaze and objects which track to the user's gaze. (We do not recomment using the latter in released game, but seeing the example is likely worthwhile for many kinds of developers.)

## Requirements
* Unity 5.4.5f1 or newer
* FOVE VR 0.12.1 or newer
